## Alignment

The script below includes several key functions:

1. Downloads raw FASTQ data.
2. Performs quality control using FastQC.
3. Aligns reads to the reference genome using STAR.
4. Assesses alignment quality with Qualimap.

```{bash alignment, eval = FALSE}
#! /bin/bash -l

sample_id=(SRR6244046 SRR6244047 SRR6244048 SRR6244049 SRR6244050 SRR6244051 \

    if [[ -f "$fq1" && -f "$fq2" ]]; then
        echo "FASTQ files for $srr already downloaded."

        # Rename if not already renamed
        if [[ ! -f "$renamed_fq1" ]]; then
            mv "$fq1" "$renamed_fq1"
            echo "Renamed $fq1 to $renamed_fq1"
        fi

            mv "$fq2" "$renamed_fq2"
            echo "Renamed $fq2 to $renamed_fq2"
        fi
    elif [[ -f "$renamed_fq1" && -f "$renamed_fq2" ]]; then
        echo "Renamed FASTQ files for $sample already exist. Skipping download."
    else

    if [[ " ${skip_samples[@]} " =~ " ${sample} " ]]; then
        echo "Skipping alignment for $sample (marked for later processing)"
        continue
    fi

    # === STAR Alignment ===
    mkdir -p "./alignment/${sample}"
    STAR --runMode alignReads \
        --runThreadN 16 \
        --genomeDir /athena/angsd/scratch/miz4010/project/refGenomes/hg38_STARindex \

```

The bone marrow CD69⁻ sample from donor 1 was split into two sub-samples due to multiplexing. After quality control, no significant technical bias was detected between them. Therefore, the two sub-samples were concatenated prior to alignment. The corresponding scripts are provided below.

```{bash alignment_special, eval=FALSE}
#! /bin/bash -l

zcat ./raw_fastq/bm_cd69neg_ind1_1_1.fastq.gz ./raw_fastq/bm_cd69neg_ind1_2_1.fastq.gz | gzip > ./raw_fastq/bm_cd69neg_ind1_1.fastq.gz
zcat ./raw_fastq/bm_cd69neg_ind1_1_2.fastq.gz ./raw_fastq/bm_cd69neg_ind1_2_2.fastq.gz | gzip > ./raw_fastq/bm_cd69neg_ind1_2.fastq.gz

read1="./raw_fastq/bm_cd69neg_ind1_1.fastq.gz"
read2="./raw_fastq/bm_cd69neg_ind1_2.fastq.gz"
sample="bm_cd69neg_ind1"

conda activate angsd

STAR --runMode alignReads \
    --runThreadN 16 \
    --genomeDir /athena/angsd/scratch/miz4010/project/refGenomes/hg38_STARindex \
    --readFilesIn ${read1} ${read2} \
    --readFilesCommand zcat \
    --alignIntronMax 100000 \
    --alignSJDBoverhangMin 3 \
    --outFileNamePrefix "./alignment/${sample}/${sample}.STAR." \
    --outSAMtype BAM SortedByCoordinate \
    --outSAMunmapped Within \
    --outSAMattributes All

samtools index -@ 16 "./alignment/${sample}/${sample}.STAR.Aligned.sortedByCoord.out.bam"

conda activate qualimap
qualimap bamqc -bam "./alignment/${sample}/${sample}.STAR.Aligned.sortedByCoord.out.bam" \
    -outformat PDF -outfile "${sample}.STAR.report.pdf"

echo "Finished processing $sample"

```

## Quality control and read count generation

The following script runs QoRTs to perform additional alignment quality checks.

```{bash qorts, eval = FALSE}
#! /bin/bash -l

conda activate qorts
qorts_jar="/athena/angsd/scratch/diz4009/qorts/hartleys-QoRTs-099881f/QoRTs.jar"

sample_name=(bm_cd69neg_ind1 bm_cd69neg_ind2 bm_cd69neg_ind3 ln_cd69neg_ind1 \
             ln_cd69neg_ind3 ln_cd69neg_ind2 bm_cd69pos_ind1 bm_cd69pos_ind2 \
             bm_cd69pos_ind3 ln_cd69pos_ind1 ln_cd69pos_ind3 ln_cd69pos_ind2)

for i in "${!sample_name[@]}"; do
    sample="${sample_name[$i]}"

    java -Xmx60G -jar "$qorts_jar" QC \
        --generatePdfReport \
        --stranded \
        --numThreads 24 \
        ./alignment/${sample}/*.bam \
        ./refGenomes/gencode.v47.basic.annotation.gtf \
        ./qorts/${sample}/
done
```

The following scripts use `featureCounts` to generate a read count table. As demonstrated in the later section, a substantial portion of reads is assigned to intronic regions — an indicator of potential data quality issues.

```{bash featureCounts, eval = FALSE}
#! /bin/bash -l

conda activate angsd

mkdir -p ./featureCounts
annot_file="./refGenomes/gencode.v47.basic.annotation.gtf"

featureCounts -T 24 \
    -a ${annot_file} \
    -o ./featureCounts/fc_output.txt \
    -s 2 \
    -t gene \
    -g gene_id \
    -M -O -p --countReadPairs \
    ./alignment/*_cd69*/*.bam

```

The generated read count table can be imported into R using the following code.

```{r load_table, eval=FALSE}

sample_names <- c(
  "bm_cd69neg_ind1", "bm_cd69neg_ind2", "bm_cd69neg_ind3", 
  "bm_cd69pos_ind1", "bm_cd69pos_ind2", "bm_cd69pos_ind3",
  "ln_cd69neg_ind1", "ln_cd69neg_ind2", "ln_cd69neg_ind3",
  "ln_cd69pos_ind1", "ln_cd69pos_ind2", "ln_cd69pos_ind3"
)

read.counts <- read.table("./featureCounts/fc_output.txt", header = TRUE, comment.char = "#", sep = "\t")
colnames(read.counts)[7:18] <- sample_names
```

## Result analysis

### Fastqc results

In general, the sequencing quality appears to be consistent and acceptable across the samples. The sequence count plots show no clear bias across tissue types (bone marrow vs. lymph node), T cell activation status (CD69+ vs. CD69−), or between different donors.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='80%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("./figures/fastqc_sequence_counts_plot.png")
```

Quality warnings are primarily driven by the GC content distribution and the presence of overrepresented sequences. An abnormal peak at the high-GC region is consistently observed across samples, likely due to the prevalence of GC-rich overrepresented sequences. BLAST analysis of the top five overrepresented sequences reveals that they all correspond to 28S rRNA, indicating potential rRNA contamination during library preparation.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='80%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("./figures/fastqc_per_sequence_gc_content_plot.png")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='80%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("./figures/fastqc_overrepresented_sequences_plot.png")
```

### Qualimap results

Reviewing the alignment statistics provided by STAR reveals that while some samples have a reasonable number of uniquely mapped reads, others—such as the lymph node CD69+ samples from donor 1—show a high proportion of multi-mapping reads. This variation suggests inconsistencies in alignment quality across samples. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='80%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("./figures/star_alignment_plot.png")
```

### Qort results

Based on the Qort quality control analysis, a substantial proportion of aligned reads are mapped to intronic regions. Among the 12 samples, those derived from bone marrow exhibit a higher proportion of genomic reads compared to those from the lymph node. This raises questions about whether the sequencing protocol used was truly polyA-selection, as stated in the paper, or if it was in fact ribo-depletion. This discrepancy also serves as a potential warning sign regarding the overall data quality.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='80%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("./figures/qorts_alignments.png")
```

## Concerns

Following alignment and quality control, there are significant concerns about the suitability of the data for downstream analysis, as some samples contain only 20–30% effective exonic reads. If the library preparation protocol was indeed rRNA depletion, I would appreciate guidance on how to appropriately handle potential pre-mRNA reads mapped to intronic regions, in order to minimize bias in subsequent analyses.
